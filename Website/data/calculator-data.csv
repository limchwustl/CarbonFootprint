Description of Factor,Value,Unit,Assumptions
Pounds of CO2 emitted per gallon,19.6,lbs CO2/gallon,"A gallon of gasoline is assumed to produce 8.887 kilograms (or 19.6 pounds) of CO2. This gasoline factor is from a recent regulation establishing GHG standards for model year 2012- 2016 vehicles (75 FR 25324, May 7, 2010)."
Ratio of emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2,1.01,lbCO2e/lbCO2,"In addition to carbon dioxide, automobiles produce methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the tailpipe, as well as HFC emissions from leaking air conditioners. The emissions of CH4 and N2O are related to vehicle miles traveled rather than fuel consumption, and the emissions of CH4, N2O, and HFCs are not as easily estimated from a vehicle as for CO2. On average, CO2 emissions represent 95-99% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from a passenger vehicle. CH4, N2O, and HFC emissions represent roughly 1-5% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles, after accounting for the global warming potential of each greenhouse gas. To simplify this estimate, it is assumed that CH4, N2O, and HFCs account for 1.5 percent of emissions, and the CO2 estimate was multiplied by 100/98.65 to incorporate the contribution of the other greenhouse gases. These percentages are estimated from the EPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990 - 2011."

Average number of pounds of CO2 equivalent per person per year that could be saved by recycling plastic,-35.56,lbs CO2e/year/person avoided from recycling plastic,"Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions associated with household waste management were calculated using the total emissions for landfills (including incineration, landfill gas-to- energy projects, oxidation, and flaring) and the United States population estimates from EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, 1990-2011. The emission factors for each material type were developed by EPA and presented in the Agency's report on greenhouse gas emissions from waste management and in the online WAste Reduction Model (WARM). These emission factors take into account the full material life cycle; i.e., not only emissions at the landfill, but also emissions and sequestration associated with production, manufacturing, remanufacturing, forest carbon storage due to reduced harvests, etc. The emission factor used for recycling materials in this calculator compares greenhouse gas emissions from recycling with those attributable to landfilling. This approach enables policy makers to evaluate, on a per-ton basis, the overall difference in greenhouse gas emissions between (1) recycling 1 ton of material and (2) manufacturing and then managing (post-consumer) 1 ton of the same material.
